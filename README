System Health Monitor

A Python-based real-time system monitoring tool that tracks CPU, memory, and disk usage with configurable alerting thresholds.

Features

- Real-time monitoring of system resources (CPU, memory, disk)
- Configurable alert thresholds
- Continuous logging to file
- Console output with visual alerts
- Lightweight and efficient

Requirements

- Python 3.x
- psutil library

Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/system-health-monitor.git
cd system-health-monitor

2. Install dependencies:

pip install psutil

Usage

Run the monitor:

python monitor.py

The script will:
- Check system metrics every 5 seconds
- Display metrics in the console
- Log all data to system_monitor.log
- Trigger alerts when thresholds are exceeded

Stop the monitor with Ctrl+C

Configuration

Default alert thresholds (edit in monitor.py):
- CPU: 80%
- Memory: 80%
- Disk: 90%

Output Example

2024-02-25 14:23:45 | CPU: 45.2% | Memory: 62.8% | Disk: 75.3%
2024-02-25 14:23:50 | CPU: 85.1% | Memory: 82.4% | Disk: 75.3% | ALERTS: ⚠️ HIGH CPU USAGE: 85.1%, ⚠️ HIGH MEMORY USAGE: 82.4%
